# IoT_Domotica

This was an intern project that has room for improvement. The internship had come to it's end, but the project has not. To further develop the system the project has been placed on Github. The project contains software and hardware. The hardware components used and the installation guide will be listed at their respective branches.

The idea of this project is home automation. The project will be further developt to be more flexible. To allow it to be a stand-alone or attached to an existing system. Although the project is still in it's early stage it is already partially functional. Given time it will be fully functional.

If you happen to find this project interesting and/or have any remarks, please feel free to contribute.
